# Documentation Instructions

This directory stores the core documents that guide the relaunch of EZ Manual Simplifier.

## Current Files

- `PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md`: High-level product goals and scope for the rebooted project
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`: Historical implementation phases and context from the previous iteration

## Maintenance Guidelines

- Keep both documents up to date as the project evolves
- Use clear headings and bullet lists so Copilot can surface requirements effectively
- Prefer Japanese for stakeholder-facing notes and English for technical checklists when possible

## Contribution Tips

- When adding new documentation, confirm it is essential for Copilot or project planning before committing
- Follow standard Markdown conventions (headings with `#`, blank line before/after lists)
- Cross-link related documents to keep navigation simple in the minimal repository
